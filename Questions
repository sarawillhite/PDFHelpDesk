Good morning,
I am fairly new to Accessibility.  We have been doing a lot of PDF remediation.  I am learning as I go- trying different things and am happy to have a place dedicated just to PDF.  IT seems as though sometimes one thing works, and another time it doesn't.  Anyways. I have ZERO coding knowlege or ability.  We are focused only on document accessibility and not the website portion.  I have no idea if I am posting this properly. Please let me know if I'm not.  I don't currently have a PDF question. But would definitely like to use this as a resource in my work.

Thanks, Sara
